This is a personal finance web application built using React and Javascript, Vite, Express, Node.js, and a few other libraries and packages.

This application allows users to log in or sign up, store their income and payment transactions, create a budget for their money, and set savings goals that they want to work towards.

The application is currently built with a SQL database stored locally, which requires MySQL to be installed and the database created on the user's machine.

This application is still a work in progress with many areas of improvement still to be completed.

Instructions to use:

1. Fork the repo to have local access and create a MySQL database using the script. Also, make sure to have all of the software packages and libraries downloaded.
2. In the terminal, change to the backend directory and execute "npm start" in the terminal.
3. Change to the main directory and run "npm run dev" in the terminal and open the link in a browser.
