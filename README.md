This is a personal finance web application built using React and Javascript, Vite, Express, Node.js, and a few other libraries and packages.

This application allows users to log in or sign up, store their income and payment transactions, create a budget for their money, and set savings goals that they want to work towards.

The application is currently built with a SQL database stored locally, which requires MySQL to be installed and the database created on the user's machine.

This application is still a work in progress with many areas of improvement still to be completed.
